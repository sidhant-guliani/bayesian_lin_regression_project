# Bayesian statistics Analysis Projects
### Projects:
1. Sunspot count
2. Sleep and awake pattern
3. Understanding of multitonial and Dirichlet project using Zoo visit data
4. Student grades data from UCI ML repository. The objective is to predict the final grade from the student information which makes this a supervised, regression task.
5. Kaggle Diabetes dataset. Objective: Given a set of eight medical characteristics about a patients, predict whether or not the patient has diabetes. We compared the performance of standard ML algorithms with bayesian statistics.

### Reports
1. Detailed report on Frequentist vs Bayesian analsis

### Scikitlearn pointer
##### sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression vs sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV
While the instance of the first class just trains logistic regression on provided data. The instance of the second class divides the Train dataset into different Train/Validation Set combinations before training and helps test the model is good across different splits of data. The process is called K-Fold Cross Validation (thatâ€™s where CV comes from) and is a very frequently used method in Machine Learning practice.
